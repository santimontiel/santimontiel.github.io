## 📝 Abstract
Robust and accurate perception of dynamic objects and map elements is crucial for autonomous vehicles performing safe navigation in complex traffic scenarios. While vision-only methods have become the de facto standard due to their technical advances, they can benefit from effective and **cost-efficient fusion with radar measurements**. In this work, we advance fusion methods by repurposing **Gaussian Splatting** as an efficient *universal view transformer* that bridges the view disparity gap, mapping both image pixels and radar points into a common Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representation.

Our main contribution is **GaussianCaR**, an end-to-end network for BEV segmentation that, unlike prior BEV fusion methods, leverages Gaussian Splatting to map raw sensor information into latent features for efficient camera-radar fusion. Our architecture combines multi-scale fusion with a transformer decoder to efficiently extract BEV features.

Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves **performance** on par with, or even surpassing, **the state-of-the-art on BEV segmentation tasks** (57.3%, 82.9%, 50.1% IoU for vehicles, roads, and lane dividers) on the nuScenes dataset, while maintaining a **3.2x faster inference** runtime.
<br />

## ⭐ Key Contributions
- **Gaussian Splatting as a universal view transformer** for heterogeneous
  camera–radar fusion in BEV.
- **End-to-end differentiable pixels/points → Gaussians → BEV pipeline**
  without voxelization or depth discretization.
- **State-of-the-art BEV segmentation efficiency**, achieving comparable or
  better accuracy than prior fusion methods with **3.2x faster inference**.

## 🔬 Method

Existing BEV fusion methods struggle to jointly handle dense image features and sparse radar measurements without costly voxelization or attention-based lifting.
GaussianCaR reformulates multi-modal sensor fusion as a **sensor → Gaussians → BEV transformation**. Unlike prior methods that rely on voxelization or costly attention mechanisms, we repurpose Gaussian Splatting (GS) as a universal view transformer to bridge the disparity between dense camera images and sparse radar point clouds.

* **Pixels-to-Gaussians** (Camera): We lift 2D features from an EfficientViT-L2 backbone into 3D space using a coarse-to-fine strategy, predicting Gaussian parameters (position, size, opacity) to mitigate depth discretization errors.
* **Points-to-Gaussians** (Radar): A lightweight Point Transformer v3 encodes radar returns, transforming sparse points into Gaussians with learnable covariance matrices to explicitly model spatial uncertainty.
* **Unified Fusion**: Features from both sensors are differentiably rasterized into a common BEV grid and integrated via CMX-based fusion layers and a DPT decoder, achieving state-of-the-art segmentation (57.3% IoU) at 75.6 ms inference speed.

This architecture allows GaussianCaR to achieve state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes (57.3% IoU for vehicles) while maintaining a high inference speed (75.6 ms), making it 3.2x faster than comparable fusion methods like BEVCar.
